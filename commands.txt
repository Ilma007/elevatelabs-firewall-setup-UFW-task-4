🔐 CYBERSECURITY TASK 4
✅ Setup and Use a Firewall on Kali Linux using UFW
🔧 Tools Required:
Kali Linux in VMware

UFW (comes preinstalled in most cases)

⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation on Kali Linux (UFW)
🔹 Step 1: Open Terminal and Check UFW Installation
sudo ufw status
If it's not installed, install UFW:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
🔹 Step 2: Enable UFW
sudo ufw enable
⚠️ Note: You may be warned that enabling UFW could disrupt current SSH connections. If you're using SSH, make sure to allow port 22 first (Step 5).

🔹 Step 3: List Current Firewall Rules
sudo ufw status numbered
🔹 Step 4: Add Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
sudo ufw deny 23
🔹 Step 5: Test the Rule
Try connecting to port 23 using telnet or an nmap scan:

nmap -p 23 localhost
🔴 Port should appear as filtered or closed.

🔹 Step 6: Allow SSH (Port 22) [IMPORTANT for Remote Access]
sudo ufw allow 22
✅ Ensures remote access isn’t blocked.

🔹 Step 7: Remove the Block Rule
sudo ufw delete deny 23
Restores firewall to original state.

🔹 Step 8: List  Final Rules Again
sudo ufw status verbose

🔹 sudo ufw status
🔸 Checks if the UFW firewall is active and shows its current status.

🔹 sudo apt update
🔸 Updates the list of available software packages on your Kali system.

🔹 sudo apt install ufw
🔸 Installs the UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) tool if it's not already installed.

🔹 sudo ufw enable
🔸 Turns on the firewall and starts blocking/allowing traffic as per rules.

🔹 sudo ufw status numbered
🔸 Lists all active firewall rules with numbers so you can identify and delete them later.

🔹 sudo ufw deny 23
🔸 Blocks incoming traffic on port 23 (used by Telnet) for security.

🔹 nmap -p 23 localhost
🔸 Scans your own system to check if port 23 is open or blocked.

🔹 sudo ufw allow 22
🔸 Allows traffic on port 22 (used for SSH) to ensure remote access works.

🔹 nmap -p 22 localhost
🔸 Scans your system to verify if port 22 is accessible after allowing it.

🔹 sudo ufw delete deny 23
🔸 Removes the firewall rule that blocked port 23 to restore the original state.

🔹 sudo ufw status verbose
🔸 Shows detailed firewall status including logging, default policies, and all rules.
